            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Ahmed Khan, a young culinary enthusiast from Gulshan-e-Iqbal, had a dream. Growing up, he watched his grandmother prepare the most delicious pakoras every evening. The aroma, the crispy texture, the perfect blend of spices - it was magic.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              After years of working in various restaurants across Karachi, Ahmed decided it was time to share his grandmother's secret recipe with the world. With just ₨50,000 in savings, a single fryer, and an unshakeable belief in his dream, Pakora Palace was born in a small 200 sq ft shop.
            </p>
          </div>

              Within two years, Pakora Palace became the talk of the neighborhood. People would line up every evening, waiting for their turn to taste the legendary pakoras. Ahmed's commitment to quality - using only fresh vegetables, premium gram flour, and his grandmother's secret spice blend - set him apart.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              The shop expanded to accommodate more customers, and Ahmed hired his first two employees. The family recipe was now feeding hundreds of families across Karachi.

              Ahmed began experimenting with new varieties. Chicken pakora, paneer pakora, and the now-famous Mix Pakora Platter were introduced. Each recipe was perfected over months of testing, ensuring it met the high standards set by the original vegetable pakora.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              The team grew to 8 members, and delivery service was launched. Pakora Palace was no longer just a shop - it was becoming a brand.

            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">

            Bilal Sheikh joined Pakora Palace in 2011 as a dishwasher. He was just 18 years old, fresh from his village in Punjab, with dreams of making it in the big city. Ahmed noticed Bilal's curiosity - he would always watch the chefs work, asking questions during breaks.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            "I saw hunger in his eyes," Ahmed recalls. "Not for food, but for knowledge." Ahmed started teaching Bilal the basics - how to cut vegetables, how to mix the batter, the importance of temperature control. Bilal was a quick learner.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Today, Bilal is our Master Chef, responsible for training new team members and maintaining our quality standards. He's perfected the art of the spice blend and can tell if a pakora is ready just by the sound of the sizzle.

            It was December 2019. Ayesha was getting married in two days, and her caterer had just canceled. In a panic, she called Pakora Palace at 11 PM, crying. She needed pakoras for 300 guests - her late mother's favorite food, and she wanted to honor her memory.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Ahmed and his team worked through the night. They sourced extra ingredients, brought in additional staff, and prepared everything fresh on the wedding day. They even created a special "Mother's Love" platter with Ayesha's mother's favorite varieties.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When Ayesha tasted the pakoras, she broke down in tears. "It tastes exactly like my mother used to make them," she said. The entire wedding party praised the food, but for Ahmed, the real reward was seeing Ayesha smile on her special day.

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            In 2016, Fatima Ali walked into Pakora Palace asking for a job. As a single mother of two, she needed work desperately. But she had no experience in the food industry. Ahmed saw something special in her determination and organizational skills.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Starting as a customer service representative, Fatima revolutionized how orders were managed. She introduced a digital tracking system, improved delivery routes, and created a customer feedback loop that helped improve service quality.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Within three years, she became Operations Manager. Under her leadership, customer satisfaction increased by 40%, and delivery times improved by 25%. She's also mentored five other women who now work at Pakora Palace.

          </div>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The monsoon rains of August 2020 devastated parts of Karachi. Thousands were displaced, homes were destroyed, and people were hungry. Pakora Palace's own shop was flooded with two feet of water.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Instead of closing down to clean up, Ahmed made a decision: "We'll clean later. People need food now." The team set up temporary cooking stations on higher ground and started preparing meals. For three weeks, Pakora Palace served free food to flood victims.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The community rallied. Regular customers donated money and ingredients. Volunteers helped with cooking and distribution. Together, they served over 10,000 meals. When asked about the financial loss, Ahmed simply said, "Money comes and goes. But humanity? That's forever."
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The story went viral on social media. News channels covered it. But for Ahmed and his team, the real reward was seeing families eat hot meals during their darkest hours.
